# delta-project
Everyone who is participating in inductions will have to make one personal project, which can be anything, and not necessarily related to your profile choice.

The project can be any working program/application that falls under the broad realm of computing, so feel free to explore and see what plays to your strengths. You are free to use any technologies, frameworks, or resources that you deem necessary - there are no restrictions. However, blatant plagiarism is still prohibited.
